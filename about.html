            <p><strong>🏏 Forged for the Brave</strong></p>
            <p>Haider is not just a brand — it's a mindset. Born from the name Haider, meaning the brave, it represents courage, conviction, and composure under pressure. The sword that runs through our emblem — the Zulfiqar — stands not for violence, but for justice, focus, and moral strength. It reminds us that true warriors win their battles first in the mind.</p>
            <p>In cricket, bravery isn't reckless. It's not swinging wildly or playing out of control. Bravery is trusting yourself when doubt creeps in. It's stepping up when the moment feels bigger than you. Too many players tighten up, play safe, or hide behind caution when the situation calls for courage. Haider was created to change that.</p>
            <p>Every bat we forge, every glove we shape, and every jersey we design carries one purpose — to unleash the brave within. They are made for players who want to break mental shackles, silence hesitation, and play with freedom.</p>
            <p>When you pick up a Haider bat, when you slip on Haider gloves, or when you wear that Haider jersey, you're not just using gear — you're stepping into a mindset. A mindset that reminds you that courage is your greatest skill. That pressure is just an opportunity. And that every brave stroke, every brave dive, every brave moment becomes part of your story.</p>
            <p><strong>Haider — Forged for the Brave.</strong></p>
